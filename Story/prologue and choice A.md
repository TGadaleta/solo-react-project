The Story
Prologue

You jolt awake, disoriented. The emergency alarm blares relentlessly, its shrill cry cutting through the air like a knife. Red emergency lights pulse, casting an eerie glow across your cabin. Your head throbs as you try to piece together what’s happening.

“Captain, please respond. Captain, please respond,” a familiar voice crackles through the intercom. It’s AURA, the ship’s AI, but there’s an unfamiliar urgency in her tone.

Option 1: Stand Up

You rise from the bed, your legs unsteady as the ship lurches violently beneath you. The deck shudders as if something has hit the ship, or worse...
But you’re in hyperspace—this shouldn't be possible. The hum of the engines, the pull of gravity... none of it makes sense.

Option 2: Go to the Bridge

You stagger to your feet, gripping the wall for support as the ship rattles again. The hallway seems narrower now, the lights flickering with each tremor. You make your way down the corridor, the ship groaning around you, and reach the bridge door.

Option 3: Open the Door

You press the button to open the door, the metal sliding with a loud screech. As it opens, the cold, sterile light of the bridge floods the space. Your heart sinks as you gaze out of the viewport.

The sight is impossible. A massive planet looms just outside, its surface stretching out far too close. You can feel the gravity tugging at the ship, pulling it helplessly toward the surface. The planet’s atmosphere crackles with energy.

Option 4: Go to the Command Chair

You rush through the door and make a beeline for the command chair. Your fingers scramble across the console knowing time is running out. AURA’s voice crackles in your ear, her usual calm now tinged with anxiety.

“Captain, the ship’s trajectory is unstable. We’ve exited hyperspace too close to the planet. We need to act quickly or we’ll crash.”

The ship continues its downward plunge, the lights flickering as AURA works frantically to regain control. You know that every decision, every second, will be the difference between survival and destruction.

Option A1: Fasten Your Seatbelt

You secure your harness, heart pounding in your chest as the ship groans beneath you. The windows shake with the pressure of re-entry. AURA’s voice echoes in your mind, her words strangely reassuring despite the chaos unfolding around you.

“Brace yourself, Captain. I’m trying to stabilize the flight path, but I need your help.”

Option A2: Check the AI for Status

You press a button on the console, signaling AURA for a status update.

The AI’s voice responds, strained yet oddly friendly, as if trying to comfort you in the face of the impossible.
“Captain... we were pulled out of hyperspace by a gravitational anomaly. The ship’s systems are failing, and we are on a collision course with the planet. The debris field around us is already interfering with navigation.”

Option A3: Try to Pull Up

You grip the controls, trying to steady your hands as you fight against the pull of the planet. The ship resists, fighting its descent into the atmosphere. Every second feels like a lifetime, the sense of impending doom building with every inch the ship sinks.

“Captain, pulling up will be difficult. The ship’s thrusters are not responding properly. You’ll need to use the auxiliary systems.” AURA's voice is more urgent now.

Option A4: Cut the Engines

You quickly press the button to cut the engines, hoping it will slow the descent. The ship’s roar quiets, but the rapid fall continues. AURA reacts immediately.

“Disengaging engines will stop the ship's acceleration, but it will not stop the crash. We need to stabilize the descent, Captain! Please, we need a plan!”

A1+A2 -> Hard Crash
A1+A3 -> Soft Crash
A1+A4 -> Hard Crash
A2+A3 -> Death by Viewport
A2+A4 -> Death by Viewport
A3+A4 -> Death by Viewport


Death by Viewport
The ship hits the ground with incredible force. Your seat harness wasn’t fastened in time, and the impact launches you from the chair. You’re hurled toward the cracked viewport.

For a fleeting moment, you see the alien landscape rushing up to meet you before the glass shatters. The last thing you feel is a sudden, jarring stop as the world fades to black.

GAME OVER
Try Again?

Hard Crash
Outcome of an imperfect stabilization attempt or letting AURA handle the landing with insufficient preparation.

The ship slams into the planet’s surface with a force that shakes every bone in your body. The sound of metal grinding against dirt is deafening, and the bridge is a mess of sparks and smoke.

Your seat harness digs into your chest, the only thing keeping you from being thrown into the chaos. Eventually, the ship skids to a stop, half-buried in the rocky terrain.

AURA’s voice crackles through the bridge, strained but still intact.
“Well... that wasn’t ideal. But hey, you’re alive! Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll need some help putting me—and the ship—back together.”

Soft Crash
Outcome of a well-timed stabilization effort, either by assisting AURA or executing a correct maneuver.

You wrestle with the controls, every muscle straining as you fight against gravity. The ship bounces hard as it makes contact with the ground, skidding across the rocky terrain.

Each successive impact is slightly less forceful, the momentum dissipating bit by bit until the ship finally comes to a stop. You sit back, gasping for breath as the straps dig into your shoulders.

AURA’s voice, calm but tinged with humor, breaks the silence.
“Well done, Captain! That was... almost graceful. Now, if only the rest of the ship survived that landing.”
