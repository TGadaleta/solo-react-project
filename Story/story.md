Death by Window
The ship hits the ground with incredible force. Your seat harness wasn’t fastened in time, and the impact launches you from the chair. You’re hurled toward the cracked viewport.

For a fleeting moment, you see the alien landscape rushing up to meet you before the glass shatters. The last thing you feel is a sudden, jarring stop as the world fades to black.

GAME OVER
Try Again?

Hard Crash
Outcome of an imperfect stabilization attempt or letting AURA handle the landing with insufficient preparation.

The ship slams into the planet’s surface with a force that shakes every bone in your body. The sound of metal grinding against dirt is deafening, and the bridge is a mess of sparks and smoke.

Your seat harness digs into your chest, the only thing keeping you from being thrown into the chaos. Eventually, the ship skids to a stop, half-buried in the rocky terrain.

AURA’s voice crackles through the bridge, strained but still intact.
“Well... that wasn’t ideal. But hey, you’re alive! Now, if you don’t mind, I’ll need some help putting me—and the ship—back together.”

Soft Crash
Outcome of a well-timed stabilization effort, either by assisting AURA or executing a correct maneuver.

You wrestle with the controls, every muscle straining as you fight against gravity. The ship bounces hard as it makes contact with the ground, skidding across the rocky terrain.

Each successive impact is slightly less forceful, the momentum dissipating bit by bit until the ship finally comes to a stop. You sit back, gasping for breath as the straps dig into your shoulders.

AURA’s voice, calm but tinged with humor, breaks the silence.
“Well done, Captain! That was... almost graceful. Now, if only the rest of the ship survived that landing.”
Scene 1

Happens after soft crash or hard crash

You wake up in your seat with a sudden jolt, the alarm blaring, its shrill sound piercing through the haze of your confusion. The emergency lights flicker, casting an unsettling crimson glow across the bridge, where half the consoles are fried and sparking. The air smells burnt—like ozone and melted plastic.

As you try to steady yourself, a faint voice crackles through the ship’s speakers, soft but still tinged with mechanical distortion.
“Ahem... Captain? I... think we’ve made an unexpected landing.”

You blink rapidly, your vision still fuzzy from the impact. The gravity is pulling harder than usual, and the ship feels uncomfortably wrong. The creaking metal and groaning walls only add to the disorienting sensation.

Your hand fumbles across the console, and you finally manage to hit the switch that silences the alarm. The eerie quiet that follows is almost worse than the noise.

You turn your gaze to the viewport. Through the cracked glass, you see the planet—the one you barely registered entering the system just moments ago—now looming much too close. The sight almost defies reality itself.

The sky is a swirling vortex of inky black and blood-red, constantly shifting like some unnatural, cosmic storm. Veins of glowing violet light snake through the clouds, casting an otherworldly glow on the landscape below. It doesn’t look like a planet—it feels like a wound in the fabric of space itself.

The terrain is jagged, broken—like the very ground has been shattered and fused back together in haphazard, unnatural shapes. The soil is black and cracked, shimmering with pools of dark liquid, reflecting strange, contorted shapes that don’t seem to align with the world around them.

In the distance, colossal alien spires rise from the landscape, their forms twisted and organic, as if grown rather than built. Their surfaces pulse faintly with an eerie light, etched with shifting symbols and glyphs—impossible to decipher.

And then, you hear it: the low hum that vibrates through the air, followed by shrill, discordant shrieks—sounding as though they originate from every direction at once. It feels like the planet itself is alive, watching you.

You tear your eyes away from the unsettling vista and glance at the console in front of you. The display is flickering, but you manage to pull up the diagnostic readout. It paints a grim picture:

Power Systems: 18% functionality. Auxiliary power active.
Hull Integrity: Critical. Multiple fractures across the exterior.
Life Support: Oxygen at 62%. Breach detected in lower decks.
AI Core: Damaged but operational. Voice functions impaired.

Four Choices:

Option B1
Inspect the Damage on Foot
You decide to leave the bridge and take stock of the wreckage outside. You’ll need to gather any usable parts, but you can’t shake the feeling that something is watching you from the shadows of the distant spires.

Option B2
Check the Lower Decks
You head for the lower levels to investigate the ship’s life support systems. The oxygen breach needs to be sealed before you suffocate.

Option B3
Run Diagnostics on the AI Core
AURA may be struggling, but she’s your best ally in this nightmare. You focus on restoring her full functionality, hoping she can provide a clearer analysis of what’s really happening.

Option B4
Scan the Planet's Surface
You attempt to scan the planet’s surface with what’s left of the ship’s console, hoping to find any crash debris or useful resources.

Scene B1

You unbuckle yourself from the command chair and rise to your feet. The low gravity of the planet makes you feel unsteady at first, but your EVA suit provides the support you need as you move. You make your way towards the airlock, your boots clanging faintly on the metal floor, a stark contrast to the otherwise eerie silence of the ship.

At the airlock, you begin preparing for the outside environment. You open the compartment and retrieve your EVA suit, a standard-issue model that will protect you from the harsh atmosphere. Checking the oxygen levels, you see that it’s completely full—no risk of suffocation, at least for now. You strap yourself in, securing every seal and latch. The suit fits snugly, but something about the tightness feels unsettling, as if it’s the only thing between you and the unknown.

You step into the airlock, and with a quick press of the button, the internal hatch closes behind you. The hum of the airlock cycle begins as it depressurizes, and you feel a strange mixture of anticipation and dread. With a final clunk, the external hatch opens. The harsh light of the alien world streams in, and you are greeted by the planet’s barren, jagged landscape.

You step out onto the planet's surface. The ground beneath you is rough and uneven, fractured as though the planet itself has been torn apart and hastily patched back together. The air is thin, the temperature frigid. As you look around, the towering spires in the distance cast eerie, twisting shadows across the land, their pulsating light faintly visible even from this far away.

For a moment, you stand there, the reality of your situation fully sinking in. The ship’s wreckage looms behind you, a twisted mess of shattered metal and broken systems. Ahead, the planet stretches into an oppressive expanse of darkness and mystery, leaving you with the feeling that something, something, is watching.

As you turn your attention to the wreckage of the ship, you wonder where to begin.

Choices:

If you’ve already scanned the planet's surface (B4), you have more specific options:

Option C1
Look at the ship and work on fixing the breach.
You take a moment to assess the damage to the ship’s exterior. The oxygen breach that’s causing life support issues may have originated here, and it’s essential to patch it up quickly to prevent further complications.

Option C2
Travel towards the towers.
The life signs detected by the scanner are drawing you towards the towering structures in the distance. Perhaps there’s someone—or something—that could provide answers or help.

Option C3
Head to the broken-off part of the ship.
A chunk of the ship was torn off in the crash, and the scanner’s map indicates it may contain valuable parts. It’s a risk, but it could offer the resources needed for survival.

Option C4
Go back inside the ship.
You reconsider the situation outside. It might be safer to stay inside the ship for now, gather your bearings, and plan your next move more carefully.

If you haven’t scanned the planet’s surface yet, the choices will be slightly more general:

Option D1
Look at the ship and work on fixing the breach.
You decide to take a closer look at the ship’s hull and the oxygen breach. You need to stabilize the life support before it’s too late.

Option D2
Travel towards the towers.
Something in the distance calls to you—maybe it’s the spires, maybe it’s the faint life readings. Whatever it is, it seems like the next step.

Option D3
Go back inside the ship.
The outside is harsh, and you have no idea what dangers await. Perhaps heading back inside will give you more time to figure things out.

Scene B4

You activate the scanner, its dim screen flickering to life. Surprisingly, it seems to be one of the few systems that survived the crash intact. The soft hum of the device fills the otherwise silent bridge, and you quickly pull up a detailed map of the surrounding terrain.

The scanner has created a rough topographic map of the area, revealing jagged ridges and broken landscapes stretching as far as the eye can see. A few points of interest show up on the map: a large pile of debris not far from your current location and a signal originating from the direction of the distant spires.

Return to Choice B but without choice B4

Scene C1
You take a moment to assess the damage to the ship’s exterior. The breach is significant—jagged, irregular edges tear through the hull, leaving a gaping hole where vital systems are exposed to the planet’s unforgiving atmosphere. From the cracked edges, you can see flickers of emergency lights from within, sparking intermittently. The low rumble of the ship settling into its new, twisted form sends a chill through your EVA suit, and you’re reminded just how fragile the situation is.

Life support is fluctuating, the oxygen level falling steadily. You need to patch the breach quickly before the entire system fails.


You spend time using the tools you have on hand which has repaired some of the damage but not all of it.
