Scene B4

You activate the scanner, its dim screen flickering to life. Surprisingly, it seems to be one of the few systems that survived the crash intact. The soft hum of the device fills the otherwise silent bridge, and you quickly pull up a detailed map of the surrounding terrain.

The scanner has created a rough topographic map of the area, revealing jagged ridges and broken landscapes stretching as far as the eye can see. A few points of interest show up on the map: a large pile of debris not far from your current location and a signal originating from the direction of the distant spires.

If AURA is at 100%

Before you can analyze further, AURA’s voice chimes in, clear and steady, with her usual calm professionalism:

“Scan complete, Captain. The debris field is approximately 700 meters northeast, likely containing structural components or essential supplies. An unidentified signal is also emanating from the spires to the west. Signal strength is weak but consistent.”

Her tone grows slightly more analytical:

“Be advised: terrain analysis indicates unstable ground in the immediate vicinity of both points. Recommend caution if proceeding on foot.”

She pauses briefly before adding with a note of reassurance:

“Despite current conditions, survival probability has increased by 12% with this scan. I am prepared to assist further as needed.”

The map continues to update in real-time, displaying dangerous terrain zones and potential navigation routes, thanks to AURA’s active processing power. Her restored functionality is already proving invaluable.

Three Choices:

Option B1
Inspect the Damage on Foot
You decide to leave the bridge and take stock of the wreckage outside. You’ll need to gather any usable parts, but you can’t shake the feeling that something is watching you from the shadows of the distant spires.

Option B2
Check the Lower Deck
You head for the lower levels to investigate the ship’s life support systems and engineering bay. The oxygen breach needs to be sealed before you suffocate and you might find some useful tools.

Option B3
Run Diagnostics on the AI Core
AURA may be struggling, but she’s your best ally in this nightmare. You focus on restoring her full functionality, hoping she can provide a clearer analysis of what’s really happening.
