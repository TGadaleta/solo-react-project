Scene B4

You activate the scanner, its dim screen flickering to life. Surprisingly, it seems to be one of the few systems that survived the crash intact. The soft hum of the device fills the otherwise silent bridge, and you quickly pull up a detailed map of the surrounding terrain.

The scanner has created a rough topographic map of the area, revealing jagged ridges and broken landscapes stretching as far as the eye can see. A few points of interest show up on the map: a large pile of debris not far from your current location and a signal originating from the direction of the distant spires.

Scene C1
You take a moment to assess the damage to the ship’s exterior. The breach is significant—jagged, irregular edges tear through the hull, leaving a gaping hole where vital systems are exposed to the planet’s unforgiving atmosphere. From the cracked edges, you can see flickers of emergency lights from within, sparking intermittently. The low rumble of the ship settling into its new, twisted form sends a chill through your EVA suit, and you’re reminded just how fragile the situation is.

Life support is fluctuating, the oxygen level falling steadily. You need to patch the breach quickly before the entire system fails.


You spend time using the tools you have on hand which has repaired some of the damage but not all of it.
