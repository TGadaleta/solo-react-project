The diagnostics process has been updated in **Surviving the Dark Planet**:  

1. **Initiating Diagnostics**:  
   - The player must run diagnostics from the **Command Chair** on the bridge.  
   - If AURA's system shows critical failures, a repair sequence is triggered.  

2. **Retrieving Repair Tools**:  
   - The player heads to the **Tool and Repair Station** on the lower level to retrieve essential electronic repair tools, such as circuit welders and diagnostic scanners.  

3. **Salvaging Components**:  
   - The player must exit the ship and travel to the **Crash Site** to recover additional wiring and key components scattered during the crash.  

4. **Completing the Repair**:  
   - After returning with the components, the player proceeds to the **AI Core** on the lower level to perform the physical repairs, restoring AURA's system functionality.
