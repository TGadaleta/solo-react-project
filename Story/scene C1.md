Scene C1
You take a moment to assess the damage to the ship’s exterior. The breach is significant—jagged, irregular edges tear through the hull, leaving a gaping hole where vital systems are exposed to the planet’s unforgiving atmosphere. From the cracked edges, you can see flickers of emergency lights from within, sparking intermittently. The low rumble of the ship settling into its new, twisted form sends a chill through your EVA suit, and you’re reminded just how fragile the situation is.

If the player does not have the plasmic arc welder (tool/repair station and crash sites), spare scrap metal (crash sites), and titanium plating (crash sites) it is impossible to repair the hull.

Option E1
Fix the breach. This repairs the hull but takes time. If life support is fixed, oxygen levels in the ship start to climb.

Option E2
Head towards the spires. An mysterious energy signature is interfering with the electronics on the ship, preventing it from powering up.

Option E3
Head towards the crash sites.

Option E4
Return to the ship
