Scene B1

You unbuckle yourself from the command chair and rise to your feet. The low gravity of the planet makes you feel unsteady at first, but your EVA suit provides the support you need as you move. You make your way towards the airlock, your boots clanging faintly on the metal floor, a stark contrast to the otherwise eerie silence of the ship.

At the airlock, you begin preparing for the outside environment. You open the compartment and retrieve your EVA suit, a standard-issue model that will protect you from the harsh atmosphere. Checking the oxygen levels, you see that it’s completely full—no risk of suffocation, at least for now. You strap yourself in, securing every seal and latch. The suit fits snugly, but something about the tightness feels unsettling, as if it’s the only thing between you and the unknown.

You step into the airlock, and with a quick press of the button, the internal hatch closes behind you. The hum of the airlock cycle begins as it depressurizes, and you feel a strange mixture of anticipation and dread. With a final clunk, the external hatch opens. The harsh light of the alien world streams in, and you are greeted by the planet’s barren, jagged landscape.

You step out onto the planet's surface. The ground beneath you is rough and uneven, fractured as though the planet itself has been torn apart and hastily patched back together. The air is thin, the temperature frigid. As you look around, the towering spires in the distance cast eerie, twisting shadows across the land, their pulsating light faintly visible even from this far away.

For a moment, you stand there, the reality of your situation fully sinking in. The ship’s wreckage looms behind you, a twisted mess of shattered metal and broken systems. Ahead, the planet stretches into an oppressive expanse of darkness and mystery, leaving you with the feeling that something, something, is watching.

If you’ve already scanned the planet's surface (B4), you have more specific options:

Option C1
Look at the ship and work on fixing the breach.
You take a moment to assess the damage to the ship’s exterior. The oxygen breach that’s causing life support issues may have originated here, and it’s essential to patch it up quickly to prevent further complications.

Option C2
Travel towards the towers.
The life signs detected by the scanner are drawing you towards the towering structures in the distance. Perhaps there’s someone—or something—that could provide answers or help.

Option C3
Head to the broken-off part of the ship.
A chunk of the ship was torn off in the crash, and the scanner’s map indicates it may contain valuable parts. It’s a risk, but it could offer the resources needed for survival.

Option C4
Go back inside the ship.
You reconsider the situation outside. It might be safer to stay inside the ship for now, gather your bearings, and plan your next move more carefully.

If you haven’t scanned the planet’s surface yet, the choices will be slightly more general:

Option D1
Look at the ship and work on fixing the breach.
You decide to take a closer look at the ship’s hull and the oxygen breach. You need to stabilize the life support before it’s too late.

Option D2
Travel towards the towers.
Something in the distance calls to you—maybe it’s the spires, maybe it’s the faint life readings. Whatever it is, it seems like the next step.

Option D3
Go back inside the ship.
The outside is harsh, and you have no idea what dangers await. Perhaps heading back inside will give you more time to figure things out.
