Scene 1

You wake up in your seat with a sudden jolt, the alarm blaring, its shrill sound piercing through the haze of your confusion. The emergency lights flicker, casting an unsettling crimson glow across the bridge, where half the consoles are fried and sparking. The air smells burnt—like ozone and melted plastic.

As you try to steady yourself, a faint voice crackles through the ship’s speakers, soft but still tinged with mechanical distortion.
“Ahem... Captain? I... think we’ve landed.”

You blink rapidly, your vision still fuzzy from the impact. The gravity is pulling harder than usual, and the ship feels uncomfortably wrong. The creaking metal and groaning walls only add to the disorienting sensation.

Your hand fumbles across the console, and you finally manage to hit the switch that silences the alarm. The eerie quiet that follows is almost worse than the noise.

You turn your gaze to the viewport. Through the cracked glass, you see the planet—the one you barely registered entering the system just moments ago—now looming much too close. The sight almost defies reality itself.

The sky is a swirling vortex of inky black and blood-red, constantly shifting like some unnatural, cosmic storm. Veins of glowing violet light snake through the clouds, casting an otherworldly glow on the landscape below. It doesn’t look like a planet—it feels like a wound in the fabric of space itself.

The terrain is jagged, broken—like the very ground has been shattered and fused back together in haphazard, unnatural shapes. The soil is black and cracked, shimmering with pools of dark liquid, reflecting strange, contorted shapes that don’t seem to align with the world around them.

In the distance, colossal alien spires rise from the landscape, their forms twisted and organic, as if grown rather than built. Their surfaces pulse faintly with an eerie light, etched with shifting symbols and glyphs—impossible to decipher.

And then, you hear it: the low hum that vibrates through the air, followed by shrill, discordant shrieks—sounding as though they originate from every direction at once. It feels like the planet itself is alive, watching you.

You tear your eyes away from the unsettling vista and glance at the console in front of you. The display is flickering, but you manage to pull up the diagnostic readout. It paints a grim picture:

Power Systems: 18% functionality. Auxiliary power active.
Hull Integrity: Critical. Multiple fractures across the exterior.
Life Support: Oxygen at 65%. Breach detected in lower decks.
AI Core: Damaged. Logical and communication function impaired.

Four Choices:

Option B1
Inspect the Damage on Foot
You decide to leave the bridge and take stock of the wreckage outside. You’ll need to gather any usable parts, but you can’t shake the feeling that something is watching you from the shadows of the distant spires.

Option B2
Check the Lower Decks
You head for the lower levels to investigate the ship’s life support systems and engineering bay. The oxygen breach needs to be sealed before you suffocate and you might find some useful tools.

Option B3
Run Diagnostics on the AI Core
AURA may be struggling, but she’s your best ally in this nightmare. You focus on restoring her full functionality, hoping she can provide a clearer analysis of what’s really happening.

Option B4
Scan the Planet's Surface
You attempt to scan the planet’s surface with what’s left of the ship’s console, hoping to find any crash debris or useful resources.
